Just finished the google spinoff website after having a **really tough time dealing with media queries and applying fluid design to the website**. Not only did I have to know how to do it, but I had to redo a bunch of elements because they weren't programmatically set up for it (A.k.a statically positioned and whatnot. It really teached me a lesson.) But I made it through and I’m now up for a new project.

Today I finished the Travelling website (hurray!) and started working on a google spinoff. **Learned how to do a hamburger, how to create a search bar, structure websites, use flexbox** (using flexbox took me the most time, but I’m starting to understand it more and more). 

I’ve come far with it and it resembles the page a lot (which I’m very picky about, almost to a fault. Or actually, to a fault. But I don’t care, I think it’s fun to design :)). I hope to finish the website by tomorrow and start something new!
